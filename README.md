# Overview of the project
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental 
disorder affecting around 5% of children globally. It manifests through symptoms of 
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can significantly impact a child's 
academic performance and social interactions. Traditional interventions include 
behavioral therapies and pharmacological treatments, which might not fully address 
individual cognitive needs or provide personalized support.
The advent of digital technologies, particularly in the realm of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and Machine Learning (ML), presents new avenues for enhancing ADHD 
management. These technologies offer the potential to develop personalized learning 
and intervention tools that adapt to the unique cognitive profiles of individuals with 
ADHD. Continuous Performance Tests (CPT) have been instrumental in assessing 
attentional capacities in ADHD; however, integrating these assessments with AI could 
revolutionize how interventions are tailored and delivered.
